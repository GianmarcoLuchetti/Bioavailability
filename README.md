# Bioavailability

Bioavailability is one of the most important pharmacological parameters to be considered in the dis vilution process of a new drug. This parameter represents to us the percent of administered drug that we actually find in the bloodstream after the absorption process. Its evaluation therefore allows us to assess several aspects, such as the efficacy and safety of an administration.

This value is generally difficult to predict, as it is related to many variables, both chemical related to the molecule, but also related to physiological processes in the body and possible pathological changes in the tissues. This project is intended to be an example of how new technologies related to data science and machine learning can be used in the pharmaceutical development process, providing probabilistic predictions in order to reduce the time and cost of work.
